Epilepsy
___________
The underlying mechanism of epileptic seizures is excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain.[12] The reason this occurs in most cases of epilepsy is unknown.[1] Some cases occur as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis.[1][2][3] Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases.[4][13] The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms, such as fainting, and determining if another cause of seizures is present, such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems.[4] This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests.[4] Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.[4]
